+**GAME OF AVENGERS**  
-----------------------
+**Game of Avengers** is a desktop game built using JavaFX and some other tools. The game has 3 levels, the difficulty of each level would be greater than the previous one. The player has to lead the heroes (Thor, Hulk, Ironman, Black widow, Captain America, Scarlet Witch) to collect the infinity stones. There are 6 stones at each level, collecting each one would increase the score by 100. When the player would collect all the stones in one level, he would be able to reach the next level. If the player could score 1800(collected all the stones of three levels), he would be the winner of the game.  
 But the player has to be careful about the blue moving obstacles as it will kill one hero, and the next hero will appear. There are also life jackets, collecting one of them will save the player's life one time (which means even if he got hit by the obstacle he wouldnâ€™t die). In each level, one could get at most 3 life jackets. The player has to be more watchful about the enemies (Loki, Ultron, Thanos) because a collision with them will kill the hero and the game will be over and no next hero will appear. The player would also lose if all the heroes got killed in one level and no heroes were left to play the game.
